# Mini Data Base Management System

A simple command-line Relational Database Management System built in C++. This project lets you create tables, insert and delete data, and run basic queries — all stored in text files. It's a great way to understand how databases work under the hood.

### Features
- Create table schemas
- Insert, delete, and update records
- Run simple queries
- Data stored in .txt files

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
   ```git clone https://github.com/GayatriMunde/DBMS_CP.git```
2. Compile the code
  ```g++ CP.cpp -o dbms```
3. Run the program
  ```./dbms```
4. You'll see a menu to interact with the system from there.

### Project Structure
- CP.cpp – main logic
- schema.txt, student.txt – sample data

### Why this exists
This was created as part of a college DBMS course to explore how database operations work without using an actual DBMS. Feel free to fork or contribute. Enjoy exploring the internals of a tiny database system!
